# Ovis: Structural Embedding Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Model

Ovis (Open VISion) is a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture, designed to structurally align visual and textual embeddings. For a comprehensive introduction, please refer to the [Ovis paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20797).

## Install
Ovis has been tested with Python 3.10, Torch 2.2.0, Transformers 4.44.2, and DeepSpeed 0.14.4. For a comprehensive list of package dependencies, please consult the `requirements.txt` file. Before finetuning or inference, please install Ovis as follows.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AIDC-AI/Ovis.git
conda create -n ovis python=3.10 -y
conda activate ovis
cd Ovis
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Model
Ovis can be instantiated with popular LLMs. We provide the following Ovis MLLMs:

## Performance
With just **10B** parameters, **Ovis1.6-Gemma2-9B** leads the [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) benchmark among open-source MLLMs within **30B** parameters.

**Ovis1.6-Llama3.2-3B** leads the [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) benchmark among open-source MLLMs under **4B** parameters, even surpassing Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.

## Finetune
Finetuning Ovis1.6-Gemma2-9B is supported in [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift).

## Inference
We provide an inference wrapper in `ovis/serve/runner.py`, which can be used as:
```python
from PIL import Image
from ovis.serve.runner import RunnerArguments, OvisRunner
image = Image.open('IMAGE_PATH')
text = 'PROMPT'
runner_args = RunnerArguments(model_path='MODEL_PATH')
runner = OvisRunner(runner_args)
generation = runner.run([image, text])
```
Based on [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), Ovis can also be accessed via a web user interface:
```bash
python ovis/serve/server.py --model_path MODEL_PATH --port PORT
```
