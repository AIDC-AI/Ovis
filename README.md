## Install
Ovis has been tested with Python 3.10, Torch 2.4.0, Transformers 4.51.3, and DeepSpeed 0.15.4. For a comprehensive list of package dependencies, please consult the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AIDC-AI/Ovis.git
conda create -n ovis python=3.10 -y
conda activate ovis
cd Ovis
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

For `vLLM`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git
cd vllm
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 uv pip install .
```

## Inference

We provide inference examples using both **transformers** and **vLLM**.

### transformers

In `ovis/serve` we provide three example files:

* **`ovis/serve/infer_think_demo.py`**  
  Demonstrates how to enable the modelâ€™s *reflective reasoning* via  
  `enable_thinking` and to control the reasoning phase length with `thinking_budget`.

* **`ovis/serve/infer_basic_demo.py`**  
  Provides inference examples for single-image, multi-image, video, and pure-text inputs.

* **`ovis/serve/web_ui.py`**
  Provides a **Gradio-based Web UI** demo.
  Example run:

  ```bash
  python ovis/serve/web_ui.py --model-path AIDC-AI/Ovis2.5-9B --port 8001
  ```

### vLLM

Start the vLLM server:

```bash
vllm serve AIDC-AI/Ovis2.5-9B \
     --trust-remote-code \
     --port 8000
```

Call the model using the **OpenAI Python SDK**:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

openai_api_key = "EMPTY"
openai_api_base = "http://localhost:8000/v1"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="AIDC-AI/Ovis2.5-9B",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/637aebed7ce76c3b834cea37/kh-1dhZRAduP-P4SkIhXr.png"
                    },
                },
                {"type": "text", "text": "Recognize the table content"},
            ],
        },
    ],    
    extra_body={
        "chat_template_kwargs": {
            "enable_thinking": True,
        },
        "mm_processor_kwargs": {
            "images_kwargs": {
                "min_pixels": 1048576,   # 1024 * 1024
                "max_pixels": 3211264    # 1792 * 1792
            }
        }
    }
)

print("Chat response:\n", chat_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### Explanation of `extra_body` parameters:

* **`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`**
  Enables *thinking mode* (reflective reasoning).

* **`mm_processor_kwargs.images_kwargs.min_pixels / max_pixels`**
  Controls the resolution range of input images (in total pixel count), balancing accuracy and GPU memory usage.


## Model Fine-tuning

Ovis can be fine-tuned using either the provided training code in this repository or via [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift).


### 1. Fine-tuning with in-repo code

#### Data Format

The training dataset is stored as a **JSON list**, where each element corresponds to a single sample.
Example dataset JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1354,
        "image": "1354.png",
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<image>\nIn the figure, the vertices of quadrilateral ABCD intersect square EFGH and divide its sides into segments with measures that have a ratio of 1:2. Find the ratio between the areas of ABCD and EFGH."
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "5:9"
            }
        ]
    }
    // ...
]
```

#### Dataset Information

Datasets are referenced via **datainfo JSON files**, e.g. `ovis/train/dataset/ovis2_5_sft_datainfo.json`:

```json
{
    "geometry3k_local": {
        "meta_file": "path/to/geometry3k_local.json",
        "storage_type": "hybrid",
        "data_format": "conversation",
        "image_dir": "path/to/images/"
    }
}
```

* `meta_file`: path to the converted dataset JSON file (a list of samples).
* `storage_type`: usually set to `"hybrid"`.
* `data_format`: usually set to `"conversation"`.
* `image_dir`: directory path containing the referenced images.

#### Training Script

We provide example training scripts under `scripts/`.
For instance, to fine-tune Ovis2.5 with SFT:

```bash
bash scripts/run_ovis2_5_sft.sh
```

This script configures the DeepSpeed engine, dataset paths, and model checkpoint initialization. Modify it to match your own dataset and environment.

### 2. Fine-tuning with ms-swift

Alternatively, Ovis models can be fine-tuned using [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift), a flexible training framework for LLMs.
